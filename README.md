A general-purpose mixin facility
================================

The Composable class can provide your JavaScript framework or application with a
flexible mixin architecture. Composable takes the form of a general-purpose
factory for composing classes and objects from mixins. You can configure its
behavior through *composition rules*: functions that run at class creation time
to resolve conflicts in property or method names. This architecture lets you
achieve a good separation of concerns, and address scenarios which are difficult
to solve with classical inheritance.

Features:

1. Focuses exclusively on composing behavior, independent of any particular
   framework. Composable can be used in a wide variety of situations.
2. Leverages the JavaScript prototype chain as a unifying data structure. This
   provides a solid basis for explaining how mixins are composed together, and
   takes advantage of native language features.
3. Supports both implicit and and explicit means of resolving conflicts in
   property and method names. Implicit resolutions provide good default
   behavior, and explicit resolutions let you accommodate novel situations.
4. Designed with forthcoming JavaScript features in mind, including the `class`
   keyword in ES6 and decorators in ES7. All features are also available in
   plain ES5.

The Composable class can be installed from this repository via npm. Composable
can then be imported as an ES6 module from `/src/Composable.js`. An ES5-ready
version can be included from `/dist/Composable.js`.


Issues that come up with mixins
-------------------------------

Many JavaScript frameworks include a mixin facility in their class factory, but
the behavior of the resulting composed class varies from framework to framework.
A critical question is how the framework resolves conflicts in the names of
properties or methods supplied by mixins. Consider how you might create a class
with mixins in a typical framework:


    let mixin1 = {
      foo() {
        // Do mixin 1 work here...
        return "mixin1";
      }
    };
    let mixin2 = {
      foo() {
        // Do mixin2 work here...
        return "mixin2";
      }
    };
    let MyClass = TypicalFramework.createClass({
      foo() {
        // Do base class work here...
        return "MyClass";
      }
      mixins: [mixin1, mixin2]
    });

    let instance = new MyClass();
    instance.foo(); // Returns... what? And what work got performed?


The base class and the two mixins all define a method called `foo()`, but we
don't know what will happen when we invoke that method:

* Depending on the framework, the invocation of `instance.foo()` might invoke
  all the `foo` implementations, or perhaps just one. If it just invokes one,
  that might be `mixin2.foo()`, because that was the "last writer", or it might
  be `MyClass.foo()`, because that's the base class and perhaps more important.

* We have to wonder not only about what work will be performed, but also about
  what result will be returned. The answer will vary from framework to
  framework.

* The answer may also depend on the specific *name* of the method in conflict.
  Some frameworks apply one conflict-resolution strategy to methods with special
  names (for example, component lifecycle methods), and a different strategy to
  other methods.

* We also have to wonder about what other side effects this framework's
  `createClass()` factory performs. Most frameworks will do more work than just
  applying mixins. That black-box approach makes class creation feel magic,
  hampers understanding, and may complicate debugging.


How the prototype chain works in JavaScript
-------------------------------------------

As a quick review, every object in JavaScript has a
[prototype chain](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=JavaScript%2FGuide%2FInheritance_and_the_prototype_chain):
a linked list of prototypes that define the properties and methods available on
that object. The following code defines a simple class hierarchy:


    class BaseClass {
      foo() {
        return "BaseClass";
      }
    }

    class Subclass extends BaseClass {
      foo() {
        return "Subclass";
      }
    }

    let instance = new Subclass();
    instance.foo(); // Returns "Subclass"


This code creates the following prototype chain:


    instance → Subclass → BaseClass → Object


To execute the `foo()` method on the object `instance`, the JavaScript engine
starts at the head of this chain (`instance`) and walking down the chain (here,
to the right) until it finds an object that has a `foo` method. In this case,
the first `foo` implementation belongs to the prototype for Subclass.
Therefore, when we execute `instance.foo()`, it will be Subclass' implementation
that is invoked. Although BaseClass also has an implementation of `foo`, it's
effectively obscured or overridden by the presence of Subclass' `foo()` method.

That behavior is inherent in the JavaScript prototype chain, and cannot be
changed. When working with mixins, however, such behavior is often undesirable.
A mixin may want to *augment* the behavior of a base class. In the context of
the example above, we may want a way to run *both* the `foo()` implementations
of Subclass and BaseClass.

One standard way to solve this problem in ES6 is to use the `super` keyword,
which lets a class invoke a method implementation further up the prototype chain.
However, the use of `super` in a mixin is tricky because *mixins don't know
ahead of time what base class they will be extending*.

* An ES6-to-ES5 transpiler, like [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for example, will
  attempt to translate a `super` call into a hard-coded reference to a base
  class. That won't work if the mixin doesn't have a base class at compile time.
* A mixin written for native ES6 still needs to know whether it should invoke
  `super` or not. The mixin may have been applied to a base class that doesn't
  include the property or method defined by the mixin, in which case invoking
  `super` will throw an exception.
* Property getters and setters are particularly tricky to implement in a mixin.
  If a mixin supplies a getter but fails to define a setter, for example, the
  JavaScript engine will conclude there is no setter available further along the
  prototype chain.


Simple example using Composable
-------------------------------

The Composable class attempts to provide a firmer foundation for working with
mixins. A very basic example:


    import Composable from 'path/to/Composable.js';

    class MyClass {
      foo() {
        console.log("Hello");
        return "MyClass";
      }
    }

    let mixin = {
      foo() {
        console.log("World");
        return "mixin";
      }
    };

    let MyClassWithMixin = Composable.compose.call(MyClass, mixin);
    let instance = new MyClassWithMixin();

    // By default, composed methods are invoked base first, then mixin.
    instance.foo(); // Writes "Hello" then "World". Returns "mixin".


The `Composable.compose` method does nothing but compose behavior — it has no
side effects, and it does not destructively modify any classes. It just returns
a new class with the desired behavior. It has no relation to any specific
framework, and in fact this approach could be made to work with many frameworks.

The `compose` method works by extending a JavaScript prototype chain with
a copy of the given mixin(s).  The original base MyClass and the original mixin
are left untouched, but a new class is created that extends the chain:


    instance → MyClassWithMixin → MyClass → Object


The prototype chain is still working the way it always does in JavaScript: when
asked to invoke `foo()`, the language engine will start at the head of the chain
and walk down the chain until it finds a `foo` implementation. All that's
happened here is that Composable has *composed* the two `foo` implementations
here to create a single function that invokes both. Composable then adds that
composed function to the prototype for MyClassWithMixin.

So invoking `instance.foo()` has the effect of invoking `MyClass.foo()`, then
`mixin.foo()`, and getting back the result of the latter. That composition is
just the default behavior of Composable, but as we'll see shortly, other
composition behaviors are easy to arrange for.


Bases and mixins can be objects or classes
------------------------------------------

Before diving into the details of how Composable works, it's worth pointing out
that Composable works with any prototype chain. The starting point you give
`compose` can be either a base class or a plain object. Similarly, the mixin(s)
you give `compose` can be classes or objects.

So the above example could also have been written:


    class MyClass {
      ...
    }

    class Mixin {
      ...
    }

    let MyClassWithMixin = Composable.compose.call(MyClass, Mixin);


If you ask `compose` to compose a base class with a mixin class, it will not
only extend the prototype chain as described above, but it will also copy any
static methods from the mixin class to the new subclass.

The remainder of this documentation will define mixins as classes. Whether you
decide to do that is a matter of taste. One advantage of defining mixins as
classes is that it makes the mixin a first-class object. You could, for example,
use `new Mixin()` to instantiate the mixin class and get a new object. The
`class` syntax also conveys an intention to package behavior.


Composition rules
=================

In the above example, Composable resolved a conflict between a mixin and base
class method that both had the name `foo`. To do this, Composable applied a
default composition rule for resolving such a conflict. Let's look at how this
rule was applied, and how you can configure Composable's behavior for different
situations.


The key moment: adding a prototype to the prototype chain
---------------------------------------------------------

The Composable class does its critical work at the moment it adds a new mixin
to a prototype chain. In the example above, at the point a copy of `mixin` is
added to the chain, there are two `foo()` methods along the chain:


    MyClassWithMixin →    MyClass       → Object
    Mixin.foo()           MyClass.foo()


We can generalize this by just thinking about the mixin being composed in
as the head of a prototype chain, and the set of base classes along the existing
chain as constituting the tail. In the abstract:


    New prototype at      Existing prototype chain becomes
    head of chain:        the tail of the new chain:

    Mixin →               Base1 → Base2 → Base3 → ... → Object
    foo()                         foo()


When adding a new head to the chain, Composable inspects all the properties on
the new head (that is, on the mixin being composed in). For each property it
finds, like `foo`, Composable looks at the chain's tail to see if there's a
identically-named `foo` property anywhere along it. The exact point along the
tail where the property exists is immaterial. All that matters is whether the
mixin's implementation at the head of the prototype chain will obscure that base
implementation. If it will, then a composition rule can be used to reconcile the
two.


Composition rules
-----------------

Rather than applying a hard-coded conflict resolution, Composable applies
developer-configured and default *composition rules* to resolve the conflict. If
no custom composition rules are in effect, the default rule will be to compose
the two `foo()` methods together using a rule called `baseMethodFirst`:


    MyClassWithMixin →      MyClass       → Object
    composed foo()          MyClass.foo()
      calls MyClass.foo()
      then  Mixin.foo()


Calling `foo()` on an instance of MyClassWithMixin will invoke the composed
`foo()` function. As its name implies, the `baseMethodFirst` rule will invoke
the base `MyClass.foo()` implementation first, then the `mixin.foo()`
implementation, and finally return the result of the latter.

The `baseMethodFirst` rule is Composable's default composition rule for
resolving method name conflicts, but other rules are available, and new ones can
be created.

When Composable applies a composition rule, the rule only ever effects the
prototype of the new class or object being created. The rule *never* affects
anything along the tail of the prototype chain. So it is, in principle, safe to
use Composable with base classes created by manually or with other frameworks,
and still get predictable results.


Standard composition rules
--------------------------

The standard composition rules are:

* `baseMethodFirst`: Invokes the base method first, then invokes the mixin
  method, and return the mixin's result as the overall result. This is the
  default rule for methods discussed above.

* `baseSetterFirst`: This is the default rule for composing getter/setter
  properties. For getters, the mixin's getter will override the base getter (as
  usual in JavaScript). For setters, the base setter will be invoked first, then
  the mixin's setter.

* `chainPrototypes`. This is used to compose object-valued properties. This
  rule sets the prototype of the *object* value of the mixin property to point
  to the object value of the base property. The effect of this is to perform a
  shallow merge of the two objects, without copying over values. Compare with
  `shallowMerge`, which does copy over values.

* `override`: The mixin's implementation overrides the base implementation.
  This is the standard JavaScript behavior for all object members. For classes
  created with Composable, this is the default behavior only for scalar- or
  plain object-valued properties.

* `preferBaseGetter`: Invokes the base getter first. If that returns a truthy
  value, that is returned immediately. Otherwise, the result of the mixin getter
  is returned. Setters are invoked base first, then mixin.

* `preferBaseResult`: This rule invokes the base method first. If that returns
  a truthy value, that is returned immediately. Otherwise, the mixin method is
  invoked, and its result is returned.

* `preferMixinGetter`: Invokes the mixin getter first. If that returns a truthy
  value, that is returned immediately. Otherwise, the result of the base getter
  is returned. Setters are invoked base first, then mixin.

* `preferMixinResult`: The converse of the above rule. This rule invokes the
  mixin method first. If that returns a truthy value, that is returned
  immediately. Otherwise, the base method is invoked, and its result is
  returned.

* `shallowMerge`: Compose object-valued properties by copying the members of the
  mixin value over the members of base value. Compare with `chainPrototypes`,
  which has the same effect, but chains prototypes rather than copying values.

You can define other rules for your application or framework, as discussed
further on.


Specifying composition rules with ES7 decorators
------------------------------------------------

One concise way to describe and think about specifying composition rules is
with ES7 decorators. Language support for decorators is still being designed,
but the core idea is that annotations on object methods and properties can cause
functions called decorators to run. These are able to retroactively edit the
definition for the property or method in question.

While decorators are not yet a standard JavaScript feature, they nevertheless
provide a good way of thinking about how you can specify a composition rule.
Using decorators, you can override Composable's default composition rules.

For example, if you have a mixin that wants to defer to a base implementation
*if one exists*, you could write:


    class MyClass {
      get foo() { return this._foo; }
      set foo(value) { this._foo = value; }
    }

    class Mixin {
      // Provide a default value for the foo property.
      @Composable.rule(Composable.rules.preferBaseGetter)
      foo() { return "Mixin"; }
    }

    let MyClassWithMixin = Composable.compose.call(MyClass, Mixin);

    let instance = new MyClassWithMixin();
    instance.foo // Returns "Mixin", since base value is initially undefined

    instance.foo = "Hello";
    instance.foo // Returns "Hello", since base value is now defined


Because the `preferBaseGetter` rule was specified with the `@Composable.rule`
decorator, the Composable class resolved the name conflict using that rule.
Why is that rule useful? Here, the base MyClass defines a property foo that may
or may not be set. The mixin wants to provide a default value for that property
that is only used if the property value is currently undefined.

Such rules are particularly valuable when composing mixins on top of a wide
variety of base classes. Some of those base classes may implement a method in
the mixin, while others may not. This level of flexility goes beyond what's
possible in classical inheritance, where a given subclass can only extend the
behavior of a single inheritance chain. In contrast, mixins defined using
Composable can be applied to multiple base classes.


Using decorators in ES6/5
-------------------------

Until the `@decorator` syntax becomes widely available, you can also use an
helper function called `Composable.decorate()` to manually apply decorators in
ES6/5:


    class Mixin {
      foo() { return "Mixin"; }
    }
    Composable.decorate.call(Mixin.prototype, {
      foo: Composable.rule(Composable.rules.preferBaseGetter)
    });


This has the same effect as the `@Composable.rule` syntax shown above. Note
that you can use the `Composable.decorate()` helper function to apply any
function with the decorator signature, not just composition rules.


Rules are decorators (applied at class composition time)
--------------------------------------------------------

To create your own composition rule, define a function that has the decorator
signature:


    function decorator(target, key, descriptor) {}


where

* `target` is the head of the prototype chain
* `key` is the name of the method both base and mixin share
* `descriptor` is the property descriptor for the method

For example, the implementation of `preferBaseResult` (like the earlier
`preferBaseGetter`, but for methods) is:


    // Standard rule: return base's result if truthy, otherwise mixin result.
    Composable.rules.preferBaseResult = (target, key, descriptor) => {
      let mixinImplementation = descriptor.value;
      // Use a helper to find the base implementation up the chain.
      let baseDescriptor = Composable.rules.getBaseDescriptor(target, key);
      let baseImplementation = baseDescriptor.value;
      // Compose a function to run base first, then mixin.
      // Use a plain function() because we don't want to bind to current 'this'.
      descriptor.value = function() {
        return baseImplementation.apply(this, arguments)
            || mixinImplementation.apply(this, arguments);
      }
    };


Note that your composition rule will only be invoked if a name conflict actually
exists. If someone applies your rule to a property, but no naming conflict
exists, the rule will not be invoked.


Manipulating prototype chains with Composable
=============================================

Because Composable works directly on JavaScript prototype chains, you
immediately get a great deal of flexibility in how you can use it. This
section presents a sampling of ideas to explore.


Creating inherently composable classes
--------------------------------------

If you anticipate people wanting to extend your classes with mixins, you can do
that in several ways. The simplest is to derive your base class from Composable:


    class MyBaseClass extends Composable {
      foo() { return "MyBaseClass"; }
    }

    class Mixin {
      foo() { return "Mixin"; }
    }

    let MyClass = MyBaseClass.compose(Mixin);

    let instance = new MyClass();
    instance.foo(); // returns "Mixin"


The prototype chain looks like this:


    instance → MyClass → MyBaseClass → Composable → Object


This means that MyBaseClass gains Composable's `compose` method. This allows
the more concise `MyBaseClass.compose(...)` syntax instead of the more verbose
syntax, `Composable.compose.call(MyBaseClass, ...)`.


Make anything composable
------------------------

Composable will happily mix anything into a prototype chain — including
itself. This is useful if you're working with a base class defined elsewhere
and can't, or don't want to, make that particular base class composable.
Suppose you are working with a Thing class defined elsewhere, and you want to
create a composable variant of Thing that supports mixins:


    import Thing from 'some/external/dependency.js';

    // Use Composable to add a copy of *itself* to a prototype chain.
    let ComposableThing = Composable.compose.call(Thing, Composable);

    // ComposableThing now embodies composable Thing objects.
    // You can now use that to compose new classes using mixins.
    class Mixin { ... }
    class ThingSubclass extends ComposableThing.compose(Mixin) {}


The resulting prototype chain looks like:


    ThingSubclass → Mixin → ComposableThing → Thing → Object


Redefining a class to include mixins
------------------------------------

In most of the above examples, the output of `compose` is a new class. For
example, a class MyClass is composed with Mixin to create MyClassWithMixin.


    class MyClass extends Composable {
      foo() { return "MyClass"; }
    }
    class Mixin = {
      foo() { return "Mixin"; }
    }

    let MyClassWithMixin = MyClass.compose(Mixin);


But maybe you don't want to expose both MyClass and MyClassWithMixin. It's easy
enough to redefine a class to include a mixin:


    class MyClass extends Composable {
      foo() { return "MyClass"; }
    }
    class Mixin = {
      foo() { return "Mixin"; }
    }

    MyClass = MyClass.compose(Mixin);   // Redefine MyClass to include Mixin

    let instance = new MyClass();
    instance.foo(); // Returns "Mixin"


This creates the prototype chain:


    instance → MyClass (includes Mixin) → (original MyClass) → Object


Extending a base class composed with mixins
-------------------------------------------

The ES6 `class` syntax allows you to provide an *expression* as base class
for `extends`. Depending on what result you want to achieve, this can be
a concise way to compose mixins:


    class Mixin = {
      foo() { return "Mixin"; }
    }

    class MyClass extends Composable.compose(Mixin) {   // Base is an expression
      foo() { return "MyClass"; }
    }

    let instance = new MyClass();
    instance.foo(); // Returns "MyClass", since MyClass is at head of the chain


Because the base class for `extends` is `Composable.compose(Mixin)`, we get
the following prototype chain:


    instance → MyClass → (copy of Mixin) → Composable → Object


Compared to the previous example, the positions of MyClass and Mixin are
reversed. This is because here Mixin was composed into the starting point for
MyClass, rather than composed into MyClass afterwards.


Composing multiple mixins in one step
-------------------------------------

Composable's `compose` method can take any number of arguments. These arguments
will be composed onto the head of the prototype chain in the order the arguments
are supplied.


    class Mixin1 {}
    class Mixin2 {}
    class Mixin3 {}
    class MyClass extends Composable {}
    let MyClassWithMixins = MyClass.compose(Mixin1, Mixin2, Mixin3);


This creates the prototype chain:


    MyClassWithMixins (Mixin3) → Mixin2 → Mixin1 → Object


Creating classes in ES5
-----------------------

Most of the examples in this document use ES6's `class` syntax, but you can also
use Composable as a general-purpose class factory in ES5:


    var mixin = {
      foo() { return "mixin"; }
    }
    var MyClass = Composable.compose.call(
      Object,
      {
        foo() { return "MyClass" }
      },
      Mixin
    );

    var instance = new MyClass();
    instance.foo() // Returns "mixin"


The `compose` call above says: use `Object` as the base class, add in a `foo()`
method, and then apply a mixin that also has the same method.


Example: Mixins for HTML custom elements
========================================

As one example of how you could use Composable to compose complex behaviors
from mixins, let's take a quick look at creating a custom HTML element using
Composable and the Custom Elements API.


    // Create a general-purpose element base class that supports composition.
    let ComposableElement = Composable.compose.call(HTMLElement, Composable);

    // A mixin that sets an element's text content.
    class HelloMixin {
      createdCallback() {
        this.textContent = "Hello, world!";
      }
    }

    // A sample element class that uses the above mixin.
    let HelloElement = ComposableElement.compose(HelloMixin);

    // Register the sample element class with the browser.
    document.registerElement('hello-element', HelloElement);

    // Create an instance of our new element class.
    let element = document.createElement('hello-element');
    document.body.appendChild(element); // "Hello, world!"


When we're done, we've constructed the following prototype chain:


    element → HelloElement → HelloMixin → ComposableElement → HTMLElement → Object


So `element` is an instance of HelloElement composed of behaviors from
HTMLElement (so it can render), a ComposableElement (so mixins can be applied),
HelloMixin (to set its text content).



Inheriting composition rules from a base class
==============================================

As discussed earlier, the critical moment of composition comes when a new mixin
is being added to an existing prototype chain. Both sides of that operation can
influence composition. The examples of composition rules above have shown rules
being defined on the mixin. This is the most common case, but Composable also
allows composition rules to be defined on the prototype chain. Composable allows
a base class to define inheritable composition rules that are consulted whenever
that prototype chain is extended.

This is an advanced use of Composable that may be appropriate for application
frameworks. Suppose we have a framework where many classes inherit from a class
called Base. All elements that inherit from Base can define a set of string
messages as a plain object-valued property called `messages`. Normally such a
property would be overridden in a subclass, but the Base class wants to define
the default composition behavior is to *merge* the `messages` property.

Rather than using @decorators for this purpose, a base class can define
a `compositionRules` dictionary that defines default composition rules.


    class Base extends Composable {}
    // Default messages
    Base.prototype.messages = {
      greeting: "Hello",
      parting: "Goodbye"
    };
    // Define a default composition rule for the messages property.
    Base.prototype.compositionRules = {
      messages: Composition.rules.shallowMerge
    };

    let mixin = {
      messages: {
        greeting: "Have a nice day"
      }
    };

    let Subclass = Base.compose(mixin);
    let instance = new Subclass();
    instance.messages // { greeting: "Have a nice day", parting: "Goodbye" }


The Base class here defines default composition rules that are inherited down
the prototype chain. When `Base.compose()` is invoked, these default rules are
consulted, so the Mixin class doesn't completely override the Base `messages`.
Instead the Mixin's `messages` and the Base `messages` are merged.

* The `compositionRules` dictionary is itself composed along the prototype
  chain, so that different levels of the class/mixin hierarchy can contribute
  default composition rules.

* When composing a mixin onto a prototype chain, any composition rules defined
  on the mixin supersede default composition rules defined along the prototype
  chain.

The ability to define default composition rules lets a framework adopt
Composable as a mixin architecture, while preserving any special rules the
framework would like to impose regarding mixin composition.
